# Zoom-System

Project from the "Advanced Programming" course in SISE department of BGU University.

The project was written in C++ on a Virtual Machine that supports Linux.

Implements a system that simulates the "Zoom" video calling software with rooms and students (admission/removal of students inside rooms and messages only - no video transferring). Uses OOP principles to carefully handle different students request separatly.
